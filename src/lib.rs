//! Deadfish language.
//!
//! # Semantics
//!
//! Deadfish consists of four commands: increment, decrement, square, and
//! output, which operate on an accumulator. The [reference implementation](https://esolangs.org/w/index.php?title=Deadfish&oldid=6598),
//! which was written in C, defines the commands as `x++`, `x--`, `x = x * x`,
//! and `printf("%d\n", x)`, respectively. The accumulator `x` is signed, with
//! the type `int` (it's defined as `unsigned int`, but printed as signed).
//! After a command, if `x` is equal to `256` or `-1`, then it is set to `0`.
//!
//! The interpreter prints `">> "` before every command and `\n` for any
//! unrecognized command (essentially another command). Command reading is
//! buffered, so input and output are not strictly ordered.
//!
//! Deadfish is not Turing complete; however, it can be interesting to search
//! for minimal programs that will produce a sequence of prints.
